#Iot_Energy_meter

Hi everyone here is my Engineering first year project which is the Iot(Internet of things) based a SMART ENERGY METER.
The detailed discription regarding it as follows:-
An IoT (Internet of Things) smart energy meter is an advanced device that allows for more efficient and intelligent monitoring and management of energy consumption in residential, commercial, or industrial settings. Unlike traditional energy meters, which are often manual and provide limited information, smart energy meters leverage modern technologies and internet connectivity to provide real-time data and insights.
Key features and components of an IoT smart energy meter:
1.Real-time monitoring: The meter continuously tracks energy consumption in real-time, providing instant updates on power usage. Users can access this information through various interfaces, such as mobile apps or web port.
2.Connectivity: IoT smart energy meters are designed to connect to the internet, enabling seamless communication with other devices and central systems. This connectivity allows for remote monitoring and control, making it easier to manage energy usage even from a distance.
3.Two-way communication: Unlike traditional meters that only record data, smart energy meters can send and receive data. This enables utilities to remotely read the meter, perform remote firmware updates, and manage billing more efficiently.
4.Energy usage alerts: Smart energy meters can be configured to send notifications or alerts to users when energy consumption exceeds set thresholds or when abnormalities in usage are detected. This feature helps users stay aware of their energy usage and promotes energy-saving habits.
Overall, IoT smart energy meters play a vital role in promoting energy efficiency, reducing wastage, and empowering consumers to make informed decisions about their energy usage. By facilitating real-time monitoring, data analytics, and intelligent communication, these meters contribute to building a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy ecosystem.
Hence, these is a outlook of the project I have include the codes and requirment of hardware and software aslo.
